This hosted portal was made possible by GBIF and provides access to the digitized specimen collection of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam. The total museum collection is estimated to hold over 400,000 specimens, of which around 85% are digitized at the [specimen](https://www.hetnatuurhistorisch.nl/en) level and [contained][bla] in this dataset. The museum collection is continuously growing and these new specimens as well as specimens that have not been digitized before, are digitized constantly. The dataset will be refreshed about once a month and details on the new specimens will be shared here in a monthly update post.
