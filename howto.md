## Querying the dataset
On the Database page the collection data of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam is displayed. By clicking the green boxes (e.g. Scientific name) above, one can search that particular field and limit the displayed specimens to their query.

For example, by clicking Scientific name and searching for Mammuthus primigenius, all specimens of that taxon are displayed. This can be further refined by selecting other boxes and adding data in there. The box Similar text is very useful. By querying Scientific name for Mammuthus primigenius and Similar text for 'femur', all woolly mammoth femurs in the museum collection are displayed. Finally simply click a specimen to see all details of that particular specimen.
