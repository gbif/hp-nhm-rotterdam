## Querying the dataset
On the [Database page](https://hp-nhm-rotterdam.gbif-staging.org/data) the collection data of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam is displayed. By clicking the green boxes (e.g. **Scientific name**) displayed above on that page, one can search that particular field and limit the displayed records to their query.

For example, by clicking **Scientific name** and searching for _Mammuthus primigenius_, all specimens of that taxon are displayed. This can be further refined by selecting other boxes and adding data in there. The box **Keyword search** is very useful. By querying **Scientific name** for _Mammuthus primigenius_ and **Keyword search** for _femur_, all woolly mammoth femurs in the museum collection are displayed. Useful terms to search for in the field **Keyword search** include: _complete specimen_, _mount_, _skeleton_, _skull_ and _study skin_. To search for material kept on alcohol, use the term _alcohol_ in the box **Keyword search**. Searching for individual (often fossil) skeletal elements (e.g. _calcaneum_, _canine_, _mandibula_, _patella_) is also possible in that box. To limit results to either fossil or recent (preserved) specimens, use the box **Basis of record**, contained under **more**. Finally, simply click a record to see all details of that particular specimen.

Using the buttons below the green boxes, one can switch between a table view (displaying all matching records), a map view (displaying georeferenced matching records) and a gallery view (displaying photographs of matching records).
